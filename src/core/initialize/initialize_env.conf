# initialize_env - Configng V2 metadata

# Main feature provided by this module (usually the same as the module name).
feature=initialize_env

# Short, single-line summary describing what this module does.
description=Detect and expose common environment variables for other config-v2 modules

# Longer description with more details about the module's features or usage.
extend_desc=Provides helpers to detect system and project paths (BIN_ROOT, LIB_ROOT, WEB_ROOT, etc.), OS/release metadata (sourced from /etc/os-release and /etc/armbian-release), and runtime info (kernel, default network adapter, local IP/subnet). Intended to be sourced by callers; includes helpers to print or emit export lines suitable for eval. Keep side effects opt-in (INITIALIZE_AUTO) to avoid surprising behavior on source.
